### Introduction!

Several pipelines are currently available for mining GenBank for a given taxon set (see SUPERSMART and PHLAWD). However, the main goal of this tutorial is to retrieve all the available sequences for a series of species within R.    

### Hands on!

1. We need to know (1) which species (or genera,etc) will be sampled as outgroup, (2) the genes that will be used, and (3) the ingroup taxa.
