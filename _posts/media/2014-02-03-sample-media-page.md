### Introduction!

Several pipelines are currently available for mining GenBank for a given taxon set (see SUPERSMART and PHLAWD). However, the main goal of this tutorial is to retrieve all the available sequences for a series of species within R.    

### Hands on!

We first need define (1) the species names (or genera,etc) that will be sampled for the outgroup, (2) ingroup , and the genes that will be analyzed.

For this example, we're going to use

<pre style="background:#f9f9f9;color:#080808"><span style="color:#234a97">x</span> <span style="color:#794938">&lt;-</span> runif(<span style="color:#811f24;font-weight:700">1e2</span>)

microbenchmark(
  mean(<span style="color:#234a97">x</span>),
  mean.default(<span style="color:#234a97">x</span>)
)
</pre>
