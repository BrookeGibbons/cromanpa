## Summary

My general impression of biological thought is about its dependence upon knowledge that has been developed in other intellectual spheres: (i) Malthus’ assays were crucial during the formulation of the natural selection theory by Charles Darwin's, (ii) the “molecular revolution” occurred mainly due to experimental (eg. PCR) and theoretical (eg. DNA structure) developments in physics and chemistry, and even (iii) the recent “explosion” of likelihood-based phylogenetic methods are a consequence of computational and statistical improvements. Since I am aware of this, I have been interested in merging knowledge from different areas. My research background is founded in Natural History (2010-12), statistical approaches for modeling and interpreting data (2012-14), since I joined the research group of Dr. Gonzalez-Obando (2014), I have learned about taxonomic research. All of my previous research topics lead me to think about questions that were consistent and debatable only within an evolutionary context. Therefore, I began to focus all my attention on that topic since the end of 2014 until today. After all, I realized that the important thing in biological research was actually the question, and the taxonomic group was only a research subject that should not restrict the thought of an
evolutionary biologist.

My first published research was coauthored with Dr. Román-Valencia (Universidad del Quindío) and Dr. Taphorn (Royal Ontario Museum). Later, during my senior work (2015) I published along with D. Moraga, a classmate, a manuscript discussing the implications of statistical multimodel selection for improving the accuracy of ecological pattern recognition. Some months later, Dr. Tripali (UC-Santa Cruz) wrote to askme to develop a Bayesian linear regression for calibrating a paleothermometer using clumped isotopes as proxy. Until that moment, all I had done was the application of Bayesian analysis, but this encouraged me a lot to learn how to build and apply MCMC algorithms for my own problems. Before concluding this project, a manuscript that was in review about sea-skater insects of the genus Halobates, caught the attention of Dr. Damgaard (Natural History Museum of Denmark) and Dr. Cheng (UCSD), who later invited me to join in their phylogenetic proposal for the subfamily Halobatinae. All this happened, while I was working on my undergraduate degreewhich focused on taxonomy, systematics and macroevolution of the most diverse psocopteran family (Psocidae). For my senior thesis project, this was an ambitious idea, which successfully concluded in the publication of two new genera, at least 10 psocid species and new results about divergence times, biogeography and macroevolutionary aspects as diversification rates for the family. I merged three different approaches for describing several interesting biological patterns in the family Psocidae (Psocoptera), combining the recommendations and guidance of Dr. Gonzalez-Obando (Universidad del Valle), Dr. Molina-Henao (Harvard University), Dr. Garcia-Aldrete (UNAM) and Dr. Zaldivar-Riverón (UNAM).
