This is a work in progress.

Just a little something I'm using to jump start a site refresh. I like to think of it as a starter for building your own Jekyll site. I purposely keep the styling minimal and bare to make it easier to add your own flare and markup.


<form action="https://getsimpleform.com/messages?form_api_token=<form_api_token>" method="post">

  <!-- the redirect_to is optional, the form will redirect to the referrer on submission -->
  <input type='hidden' name='redirect_to' value='<the complete return url e.g. http://fooey.com/thank-you.html>' />

  <!-- all your input fields here.... -->
  <input type='text' name='test' />

  <input type='submit' value='Test form' />
</form>
